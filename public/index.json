You’re on the Hades express, mister!” 😧 So far, I’m actually really digging the feel of this movie. I like that the kids are not super annoying. Her mom is so supportive. Aw, the whistle thing! This is a good mom. I approve of this mom. augh. child abuse. dnw. Oh! Love how the protagonist is an older woman! Too bad her dialogue sounds like it was written by a man. XD Or maybe i hate how getting her to the haunted house felt so forced. “This time, I have to do it, alone.” eyyyye rollllll Her side kicks are cute but i feel like I had to see a previous movie to really understand their relationship. Called it about the whistle. =\n Socially awkward nerds fighting over… teenage girls? Young women? I can’t tell. It made me feel a bit gross, tbh. Okay, so overall, I love that the protagonist is an older woman! I felt the non-dialogue stuff was really well done but the dialogue felt stiff to me.

This has me wondering if cultural context is playing a larger role in the show than I originally thought? Or I’m more twisted than I had thought?

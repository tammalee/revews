The A rating is for sci-fi. There’s imagery in there that reminds me of some of the best Japanese horror manga Loved everything about this movie, really I want so badly to categorize this as horror because we haven’t had a good horror with a cast of ladies since The Descent! But it’s clearly sci-fi One fellah got up partway through and stumbled his way out of the theatre. He was not the only one. I would watch this in the theatre if you can! I did and sat spellbound for the entirety of it. The big screen and sound system really added to the experience ","permalink":"https://reviews.tammalee.com/post/annihilation/","ratings":["b","a"],"tags":["goth"],"title":"Annihilation"},{"categories":["horror"],"contents":" Couldn’t watch the whole thing  Yawn I might give this another go when I’m feeling mellow and in the mood for something slowish To be fair, I was a bit manic about needing to do something else and didn’t give it a fair shake Also to be fair, yawwwwwwwn. I would watch this movie when I had the flu and couldn\u0026rsquo;t move off of the sofa. Being trapped is the only way I would try watching it again.

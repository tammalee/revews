<li>Oooh yay! An anthology! This makes me hope itâ€™ll be a lot like Creepshow! (omg. The slime on the lake short messed me up for years! Especially as we often swam in lakesâ€¦)
</li>
<li>Nice intro. I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect when the opening line was uttered and it wasnâ€™t what I had expected. Iâ€™m just into the second line of the film and Iâ€™m wondering, whatâ€™s the twist? Whatâ€™s going on?</li>
<li>Hahahaha a cassette tape. I wonder how many people born in the 2000â€™s saw this movie and went, wtf is that thing? I also love how the cassette player he had was the classic â€˜movieâ€™ one.</li>
<li>It must be so much fun for an actor to play a grumpy old man who gives zero fucks.</li>
<li>Huh. I wonder why the shot emphasized the number on the door? Or is that my imagination?</li>
<li>OHHHHH snap! His hero just slapped him the fuck doooown! Great men and women donâ€™t like to be emulated.</li>
<li>OH!!! Oh!!! This is the framework for the anthology! I see! I very much like this. So, the framework is a retired paranormal debunker is troubled by three cases he couldnâ€™t disprove and heâ€™s passed those cases down to a debunker younger than he is to debunk for him. Brilliant!</li>
<li>Oooh subtle. The pigeon skeleton was gone the second time he went down the stairs. I am totally getting the heebie jeebies from this! (Fun etymological fact: heebie jeebies is rhyming reduplication and was invented in the early 1900â€™s by a cartoonist. It doesnâ€™t really come from anywhere. It was made up to mean exactly what it does today.</li>
<li>Okay, again, the doors with numbers on them. One of the doors has a 79 just like the grumpy old manâ€™s homeâ€¦</li>
<li>Oh Tony. I would have quit being a security guard on the spot after an encounter like that! ðŸ˜®</li>
<li>Augh! GOATMAN! Auuuuugh!</li>
<li>Okay. But srsly. What kind of person witnesses a bunch of bottles stacking up in front of them with nobody around to do it and THEN doesnâ€™t GTFO? NOT ME! Iâ€™d have been out the door in a heartbeat!</li>
<li>AUGH! JFC Martin, you started me!</li>
<li>WTF? WTTTFFFF? Where is this going?</li>
<li>Huh. HUH. I mean, okay? I hadnâ€™t really expected that ending but I had sort of figured something was up.</li>
<li>Great acting, btw. I just felt it was trying a bit too hard to be more high-brow than it was.</li>
<li>I would watch this</li>

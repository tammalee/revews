* Lemme preface by saying… I watched the first Halloween decades ago. I would not watch this movie (I am SO not into slasher type shows) but Jamie Lee Curtis is in it and, well, I still have a huge crush on her! XD
<!--more-->
* _Show:_ “Don’t cross the yellow line” _Me:_ “He’s gonna cross the yellow line. Dur."
* Mmmmhmm. I am JUDGING this depiction of mentally different peoples.
* bwahah, but omg. That was so silly. I liked the gravitas of the mask but to fast cut to the title like that? Ugh.
* Ha! I would live in a compound like that if I had survived Michael Myers, too! I mean, Freddy Kreugar can get you in your dreams, but Michael Myers’ is just flesh and blood, right?
* Hey! HEY! What the fuuuuck? I don’t care about teenagers! I thought I was here to see a silver fox fork Michael Myers in the front-butt!
* Wow. Jamie’s daughter’s actress is really not the best. 
* <:O They killed a kid? gawddamn.
* Ugh. Right. Is it really a slasher film if there aren’t naked bloody boobies?
* Welp! I made it to the 39:54 mark before I had to bail. Srsly. Horror movies where people are shitty to other people are just not my jam. I KNOW people can be shitty. I KNOW. 
* I would watch this movie… never? Sorry! It’s just not my thing. Jr. High School me watched slasher flicks and thought the violence was cartoony but present day me finds it too depressingly real.
* Oh, and Jamie Lee Curtiss aged well!

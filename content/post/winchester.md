* Who knew a kid with a sack over his head would be scary?

* Aunt Sarah suuuuure has a lot of rules.
* LOL Jump scares! XD Laudnum and ghosts. Whatta combo!
* Let’s be frank. This was super boring, I wasn’t into it, and I didn’t finish watching it. Yawn.
* I would watch this movie… with a group of friends only to make fun of it.

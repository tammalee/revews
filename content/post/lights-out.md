* Oooh! A monster I haven’t seen before!
<!--more-->
* This was really close to an A for me but there was something… that just didn’t give it the nudge it needed.
* Ugh. Right in the feels on a personal level. Life is hard when one of your parents is struggling with a mental illness. Unlike Babadook, however, the monster isn’t intended as a metaphor. Unless that went sailing right over my head? XD 
* I actually feel for all of the characters and I’m nervous the boyfriend is going to be a statistic!
* Great monster! Not too much explained but enough that we’re left scratching our heads. Was Diana ever human? Was Sophie special in a way that wasn’t articulated?
* I liked the interpersonal relationships enough that I watched the credits and whom do I see as a producer but James Wan! I think I’m realizing I am a fan of his work! Does that mean I’m ready to watch Saw? HECK NOOOOO!

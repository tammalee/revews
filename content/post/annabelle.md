* There were some really good parts; like the elevator! Augh! And I find dolls to be inherently creepy/scary anywaysâ€¦

* NEEDED THE WARRENS!
* There was a lot inherently scary about being haunted by a murder doll. I will grant it that.
* I really didn't give two poops about the protagonists.
* I would watch this movie for the sake of being a completionist. Probably will rewatch it next time I rewatch everything in the Conjuring-verse.

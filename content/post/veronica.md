* Maybe because I was a latch key kid with a younger brother to care for I really felt for Veronica?

* Great show! Not super scary but tense. Her younger siblings being in danger added nice tension
* It had a lot of classic elements of horror but maybe being Spanish added enough charm that the classic elements weren’t too cliché?

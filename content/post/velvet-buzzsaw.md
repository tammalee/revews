* Looooove the opening credits!
<!--more-->
* This whole opening is so pretentious but it feels so on-point, as well. 
* Morf? Is that Jake’s character’s name? XD He wields the power of review like a weapon.
* SO classic! “Looks like the old guy tried to do it [destroy his art] himself but he died before he could finish the job”. This is the FIRST horror beat we really get in this show!
* I am loving this blend of supernatural and pretentious ruthless fine arts!
* I burst out laughing at the Sphere death.
* AHahhahah oh Coco! You’re the best character! XD
* Oooh that's an interesting death!
* I love so much about this show! However, it did fall short a bit on the horror. Still, I enjoyed the heck out of it!
* I would watch this show after going to an art gallery; not before. =p

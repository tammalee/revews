* Loved the Nordic mythology
<!--more-->
* Lovely landscapes and I liked the blending of memory/dream/reality
* The monster was surprisingly unique!
* Otherwise, meh
* Would watch on a Friday night with pizza with a couple of girlfriends but I'd probably do a lot of catcalling the screen or MST3king.

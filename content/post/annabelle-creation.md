* Okay. So far this movie has had a haunted doll, haunted Punch n Judy puppets, and now... a HAUNTED SCARECROW?!? If it wasn't so scary I'd be rolling my eyes!

* Another great movie in the Conjuring universe!
* Auuuuugh!
* I felt genuinely sad for Janice. She had a hard time
* Ohhhhhhhh... that's how they tie this movie to Annebelle? Cool!
* I would watch this movie when I want a genuine scare and am feeling the girl power thang.

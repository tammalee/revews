* Oh sure, it isn’t traditional horror but the film had lovely horror elements
<!--more-->
* The B rating is for horror. The A rating is for sci-fi.
* There’s imagery in there that reminds me of some of the best Japanese horror manga
* Loved everything about this movie, really
* I want so badly to categorize this as horror because we haven’t had a good horror with a cast of ladies since The Descent!
* But it’s clearly sci-fi
* I would watch this in the theatre if you can! I did and sat spellbound for the entirety of it. The big screen and sound system really added to the experience

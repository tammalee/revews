* REALLY intro music? 
<!--more-->
* Nice house! Is that Craftsman style? 
* There should be a House Hunters: Haunted show!
* Is it really common to have air ducts in a home covered with a grill and big enough for a child to crawl in? Do Canadians just not have residential HVAC systems like that?
* Know what, movie dad? My Instagram account shows that people DO care what you eat for breakfast.
* Wow. Bad acting. XD Ironic because… she’s practicing lines! Her dad sucks as an actor.
* Fashion is such that I cannot place what time this is set by Quinn's clothes. XD High-waisted bellbottom jeans? Nope. Can’t tell.
* Second-hand embarrassment from Quinn's audition.
* Auuuugh two broken legs and trapped in bed with a demon/ghost running around? I like it! XD
* AW GURL! DON’T LOOK UNDER THE BED! Who does that? Jfc.
* Now a neck brace, too? 
* Okay, so is the trend with Insidious that dead mothers rescue people in The Further? 
* I would watch this on Mother's day to remind me that a good mom will rescue you from monsters.

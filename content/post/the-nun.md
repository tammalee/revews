* THAT is a French Canadian accent? XD
<!--more-->
* I feel like “Frenchie” is concentrating so much on accent he’s missing out on acting.
* There is NO. WAY. the ice house would be cold enough to freeze a body solid enough that her fingers crack and break when you bend them. Not a chance!
* Frenchie is way too clean for having just dug a grave. 
* Join us next week when I roast someone other than Frenchie. Gawd this character. 9_9
* DETAILS PEOPLE! The bells on the graves? If they’re truly that old, the strings would’ve rotted away. It isn’t as if they would have been selected for longevity! If you’ve been buried for over a month you’re probably gonna be dead for real even if they buried you alive.
* Okay, I’m with Frenchie… a chance to peek in the scary old castle turned nunnery shows up… I’mma gonna stick my head in.
* That’s no abbess! It’s a MAN! XDDDD
* Um, Frenchie? They did just tell you the nuns take a vow of silence from sundown to sunup. Respect it!
* WHAT? Oh jfc. That’s not — ugh. The Conjuring universe is supposed to be a bit more classy than this. -_-
* Does EVERY Vatican exorcist have a past where they exorcised someone who died and now they carry around the guilt? How about a ‘dun care ebil gone’ type who believes that as long as the demon is gone a dead body is okay?
* It’s 2019 and I started watching The Nun again. -_- I can’t believe I rented this twice to try to get through it.
* Yes, we totally knew the jingly tombstone bells would come into play. Sheesh.
* Listen. Jr. Nun. You know someone is out there killing nuns and yet you go outside during the night in your nightgown… ugh. 
* okay, the scene in the chapel with the praying sisters and the shadow that stalks around the room was pretty good
* okay, you’re in a coffin. Underground. You have limited oxygen and you… light your lighter to look around? WTF?!
* Holy. Crap. You just used ALL of Jesus’ blood? ALL OF IT? that is a FINITE RESOURCE lady! Cripes. It isn’t as if it works in the long run; I’ve seen Conjuring 2.
* I would watch this... __sigh__ when I'm rewatching everything in the Conjuring-verse. Why do I hate myself so much?

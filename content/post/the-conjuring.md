**Rating:** A+++

* This felt genre-defining
<!--more-->
* Great acting
* Genuine scares
* The relationship between the ghost hunter couple is so compelling
* I would watch this on a sunny afternoon! Then Iâ€™d go for a walk and let the sunshine remind me that it was just a movie. Just a movie. Just a movie. XD

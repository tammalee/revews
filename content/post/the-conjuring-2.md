* The Warrens need their own tv show!
<!--more-->
* I thought this one was scarier than the first in some ways
* Just love this and the first Conjuring to pieces! So good!
* Wow. This really IS a crap review. I should rewatch the show but this time take some real notes. The first time I watched it, I was just so enthralled I forgot to write things down!

* The thing is, teen-me would’ve probably liked this.
<!--more-->
* I can’t believe adult-me watched it.
* Oh wait, yes I can. Jason. Isaacs. 
* Dammit, why is he at his hottest when he’s a total asshole?
* I actually was into this movie for an explanation of why the sonogram at the beginning had a second baby sort of… appear. I was hoping for something cool! It was… disappointing. Like, c’mon people. Use your imaginations more!
* Maybe if I found skinny teenage girls attractive I would’ve liked this movie more? Too bad I don’t find skinny teenage girls attractive. Boo for me.
* It was okay-ish as a revenge type movie but the ending didn’t resolve anything.
* I would watch this movie… with preteen during a sleepover. Oh wait, there’s full frontal female nudity and teens having sex. I guess it could be an educational moment if I had parental permission from all the parents? Girls, this is how you can tell your ‘friend’ is actually a huge asshole and you should end your toxic friendship. Don’t fucking talk to your reflection IF IT ANSWERS BACK! JFC! This is basic shit! And for crying out loud, there isn’t any sex under the sun worth killing someone for. …and always practice safe, sane, and consensual sex kiddos.

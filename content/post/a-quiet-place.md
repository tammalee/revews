* Never have I ever been more certain of my decision not to have children than when I watched this movie! Haha!
<!--more-->
* It felt like a children’s game made into a horror movie and I dug that feeling.
* Man. Did I ever have hate in my heart for the daughter, this movie gave me a lot to think about! And it made me appreciate how hard being a parent can be.
* After watching this show, I have added ‘what to do if monsters who attack based on sound overrun the earth’ to the disaster scenarios I plan for. First step: thick socks. Second step: no children.
* I would watch this when I'm alone and with headphones on.

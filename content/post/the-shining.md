* Haha omg the opening credits. XD 
<!--more-->
* The Rocky Mountains. So majestic. Huh, I think I’ve driven on that road before.
* That’s a nice resort/chalet. I wonder what it is…The Stanley Hotel and it is in Colorado. No wonder I’m seeing Rocky Mountains!
* Uh ohhhh drunkard Jack. I wonder if he lost his teaching job due to that?
* omg. The 70’s. No mandatory seatbelt laws, smoking as a social nicety, bwahha.
* People are so polite. But then, they use the N-word. Jarring!
* The shining is so interesting!
* Jack cannot act like a normal, innocent person can he? 
* I’m seeing so many scenes that NBC Hannibal referenced! XD 
* I would watch this movie for the historical value and to feel a bit edjumacated.

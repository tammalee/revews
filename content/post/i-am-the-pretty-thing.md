* Couldn’t watch the whole thing
<!--more-->
* Yawn
* I might give this another go when I’m feeling mellow and in the mood for something slowish
* To be fair, I was a bit manic about needing to do something else and didn’t give it a fair shake
* Also to be fair, yawwwwwwwn.
* I would watch this movie when I had the flu and couldn't move off of the sofa. Being trapped is the only way I would try watching it again.

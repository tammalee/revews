* Apparently, Buick will be leading the world in self-driving autonomous vehicles
* Oooh a secret operation at someone’s home away from ‘official eyes’ THIS seems like a good decision
* Oh nooo, Grey! Don’t let creepy young Eron operate on youuuu! Just because he’s smart doesn’t mean he’s wise!
* j/k you know I think Eron’s the coolest. I do love me the oddballs.
* Omg. This actor is great! Since getting Stem installed he’s moving as if Stem is moving him. This is really interesting! His body moves independently of his face! I can’t even rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time. Actor is killing it.
* Interesting, the neighbourhood Grey came from has a bar with no online references because they like it that way
* Vomit scene. Ew.

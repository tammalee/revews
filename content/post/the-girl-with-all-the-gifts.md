* Ooh I had a chill run down my spine when it was obvious the children were… raised in captivity? They’ve grown up like this? Creepy.

* The vision of a room full of half-restrained children cracking their jaws and gnawing at the air will now haunt my quiet moments.
* I wrote a short story many years ago about a team of scientists who released an ancient spore (while drilling ice in the antarctic) that turned people into zombies then grew out of their eye sockets to release more spore. This movie was a bit like seeing my short story come to life! So, naturally, I feel it was pretty awesome. XD
* This felt way more sci-fi than horror to me despite zombies being the movie monsters. The focus wasn’t on the horror, it was on the intellectual exercise of humanity as we know it coming to an end and being carried on by something else.
* I would watch this after babysitting at a children's birthday party.

* I’ve only seen the first Insidious movie, let’s see how much I understand watching this one
<!--more-->
* “They’re frying someone, pops! You’re on the Hades express, mister!”  😧
* So far, I’m actually really digging the feel of this movie. I like that the kids are not super annoying. 
* Her mom is so supportive. Aw, the whistle thing! This is a good mom. I approve of this mom.
* augh. child abuse. dnw.
* Oh! Love how the protagonist is an older woman! Too bad her dialogue sounds like it was written by a man. XD Or maybe i hate how getting her to the haunted house felt so forced.
* “This time, I have to do it, alone.” eyyyye rollllll
* Her side kicks are cute but i feel like I had to see a previous movie to really understand their relationship.
* Called it about the whistle. =\
* Socially awkward nerds fighting over… teenage girls? Young women? I can’t tell. It made me feel a bit gross, tbh.
* Okay, so overall, I love that the protagonist is an older woman! I felt the non-dialogue stuff was really well done but the dialogue felt stiff to me.

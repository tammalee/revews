* Ugh. RIGHT IN THE FEELING GLAND!
<!--more-->
* I really appreciate the lack of bitterness from the oldest son, Ethan, when he has to put his dreams on hold.
* There was some excellent creep factor going on but ultimately this felt like a sci-fi and not a horror movie
* I would watch this on a Saturday afternoon just for funsies. It sort of felt like a Disney film from the 80's.

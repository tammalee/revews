* Lovely to look at
<!--more-->
* Shallow and a little depressing
* Very disappointed in the ‘big secret’
* Gothic af
* I’d watch it on a bleh afternoon when I had period cramps and just wanted something light and pretty with some sadness to look at. Srsly. Not very scary, sort of stupid, but lovely visuals.

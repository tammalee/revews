* Augh. AUUUGH. There is something so disturbing about these videos.
<!--more-->
* CREEPY INVISIBLE CHILDREN!
* CREEPY HOME MOVIES!
* AUUGHGHGHGGH THAT LAWN MOWER! Barf.
* Ethan Hawke plays the most ‘writer’y writer I’ve ever seen. Cable-knit sweater with leather elbow patches, glasses onna string around his neck, drinking scotch while working alone at night… 
* AS SOON as they had an explanation for what the main evil was I started to lose interested. I did NOT need to know who he was or get an explanation of what he was doing. If they had left that out, the movie would’ve been 100x more disquieting!
* I would watch this movie if I wanted to be genuinely creeped out!

* Not very scary
<!--more-->
* Found the kids swearing so much to be highly entertaining
* Skarsgaard did a good Pennywise but he looked almost too polished. I like a Pennywise that looks like he's in drag and lives in a sewer.
* Did I mention it wasn't very scary? Because, it wasn't very scary. 
* This might be because I was familiar with the movie and knew what Pennywise was.
* I would watch this movie with someone who knows nothing about It just to enjoy their reactions.

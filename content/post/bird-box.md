* I’ve been avoiding this because it seems like another A Quiet Place but here we go!
<!--more-->
* Sandra Bullock makes anything watchable, right?
* I like how it starts with us right in the thick of things. Wait to get me emotionally invested from the outset!
* The fear is real when you hear a mother explicitly say she will hurt her children if they disobey her
* I had to pause but that totally was a human skeleton in a rotted old sundress on the lawn. I had wondered if it was a dog or something and it was a hint that this horror would affect domesticated animals, too
* Ooooooooohhfhfhfhfsadklfhjadskj I am hella invested.
* Nooo not the cool and supportive horse-sister!
* Love this first house everyone took shelter in XD
* HAHAHA Best use of a GPS in a horror movie ever!
* Oh fuck! Just when you thought they got this thing beat… survivors.
* Boy, Girl, man you're really into this mom thing aren't you? But, to be fair, if I felt my kids probably wouldn't live too long, either, would I bother with names? You gotta earn those now, kiddos. It's a new world.
* Blindfolded over rapids? D: That's a good way to lose a kid.
* Liked the ending but it was rather preditcable. From the outset I had wondered if non-visual people would be affected and I guess I was right.
* I would watch this movie with a friend who hates horror but loves Sandra Bullock and see what they thought of it.

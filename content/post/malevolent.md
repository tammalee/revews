* Scotland! The 80’s! (Honestly, not half 80’s enough for my taste but perhaps they were more subdued across the Pond?)
<!--more-->
* Not enough Scottish accent, either! Pah!
* Ooh, I love these sort of shows! Fakers turn out to be… real? Hrrrrm?!
* Why are guys named ‘Jackson’ always assholes?
* Nosebleeds = psychic powers. I wonder when this visual clue first started in film?
* JACKSON YOU ARE A DICK. I get you’re desperate but augh.
* Nooo a little murdered girl’s ghost who shares my naaaaame. This is going to be so weird.
* Gross. GROSS. I was here to see ghosts not murderporn. Gag. 
* I totally called the twist, btw. 9_9
* I donno, this wasn’t a terrible movie. It had it’s okay moments. I liked the premise. But it just meeeehhhhhhh’d out towards the end and got gross.
* Last line was tres cheesy.
* I would watch this NEVER AGAIN omg. I hate tortureporn/murderporn etc and switching to that halfway through really turned me off of this show.

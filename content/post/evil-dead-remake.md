* WHO BRINGS AN ELECTRIC KNIFE TO A CABIN?
<!--more-->
* Ooh, setup.
* There is no way she was the only one who smelled something rank in that cabin. NO WAY! A dead squirrel is enough to make people complain!
* Ugh. So much vomit. This is not the horror I am here for.
* I hate the girl going through withdrawal so much.
* __sighs__ Honestly, this is holding no surprises for me. Stopped watching about forty minutes in.
* WHY remake this movie? WHYYYYYY?

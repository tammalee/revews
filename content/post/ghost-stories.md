* Oooh yay! An anthology! This makes me hope itâ€™ll be a lot like Creepshow! (omg. The slime on the lake short messed me up for years! Especially as we often swam in lakesâ€¦)
<!--more-->
* Nice intro. I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect when the opening line was uttered and it wasnâ€™t what I had expected. Iâ€™m just into the second line of the film and Iâ€™m wondering, whatâ€™s the twist? Whatâ€™s going on?
* Hahahaha a cassette tape. I wonder how many people born in the 2000â€™s saw this movie and went, wtf is that thing? I also love how the cassette player he had was the classic â€˜movieâ€™ one.
* It must be so much fun for an actor to play a grumpy old man who gives zero fucks.
* Huh. I wonder why the shot emphasized the number on the door? Or is that my imagination?
* OHHHHH snap! His hero just slapped him the fuck doooown! Great men and women donâ€™t like to be emulated.
* OH!!! Oh!!! This is the framework for the anthology! I see! I very much like this. So, the framework is a retired paranormal debunker is troubled by three cases he couldnâ€™t disprove and heâ€™s passed those cases down to a debunker younger than he is to debunk for him. Brilliant!
* Oooh subtle. The pigeon skeleton was gone the second time he went down the stairs. I am totally getting the heebie jeebies from this! (Fun etymological fact: heebie jeebies is rhyming reduplication and was invented in the early 1900â€™s by a cartoonist. It doesnâ€™t really come from anywhere. It was made up to mean exactly what it does today.
* Okay, again, the doors with numbers on them. One of the doors has a 79 just like the grumpy old manâ€™s homeâ€¦
* Oh Tony. I would have quit being a security guard on the spot after an encounter like that! ðŸ˜®
* Augh! GOATMAN! Auuuuugh!
* Okay. But srsly. What kind of person witnesses a bunch of bottles stacking up in front of them with nobody around to do it and THEN doesnâ€™t GTFO? NOT ME! Iâ€™d have been out the door in a heartbeat!
* AUGH! JFC Martin, you started me!
* WTF? WTTTFFFF? Where is this going?
* Huh. HUH. I mean, okay? I hadnâ€™t really expected that ending but I had sort of figured something was up.
* Great acting, btw. I just felt it was trying a bit too hard to be more high-brow than it was.
* I would watch this

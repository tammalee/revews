* Senior… sophomore… why is the USA school system so weird? Just say the GRADE!

* Uh oh. Creepy little kids and Ouija boards don’t mix!
* I kind of like the idea of a family of scammer-mediums having one of them be a REAL medium
* Did they just make up that peeping through a ouija pointer thinger for the movie? Cuz, if so, well done!
* OMG! I actually jumped! Hahaha! WELL DONE SHOW! It wasn’t even a proper jump scare, it was just… corner of the eye eeek.

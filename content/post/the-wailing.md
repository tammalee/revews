**Rating:** A

* I loved quite a bit of this!
<!--more-->
* I was a bit, meh, on the ending but I liked that there were three supernatural creatures involved and they were trying to fuck each other up. XD
* Felt bad for Jong-gu.
* Honestly, it could’ve been scarier
* A Korean friend told me he’d gotten sick after watching it in the theatre because there had been so much twisted stuff in the movie. This has me wondering if cultural context is playing a larger role in the show than I originally thought? Or I’m more twisted than I had thought? As a non-Korean I thought it was well done, not too scary, and just the right amount of ‘I did not expect that’ to keep me interested!
* I would watch this… not while you’re eating bbq ribs. XD

* whuuuuuuuut is going on? 
<!--more-->
* I’m also getting low-key Hannibal Lector vibes. Probably from the blatant manipulation and hypnosis by a doctor? XD
* Okay, so… this is going where I am expecting it to go only… is it a red herring? HMMMMM!
* Boooooy, given the way she just devoured that sausage you gonna regret showing her dick. Just saying.
* Wait. So you KNOW this gal has never had a period. Like, ever, and you toss her a box of TAMPONS when you notice she’s on the rag? Has this been other women's’ experience? I was started off on pads and tampons only happened when my desire to swim overcame my fear of putting something inside of me!
* Oh grosssssss… awkward teen kisses Gross. Gag. During the party and the awkward kissing I got distracted by looking up chicken sneezes on youtube. (THEY ARE HILARIOUS) There’s only so much awkward teenage stuff I can handle.
* oooh neat, she lost a tooth. I have dreams where that happens.
* I bet one of the ‘bullies’ is going to try to rape her and she eats him, bones and hair and all. OM NOMNOM! Oh shit! Almost called it!
* Hm. And what do your eyes, newly opened by the outside world, see in your former home, Anna? 
* I mean, it's pretty nice imo. Very homey.
* WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKK I did NOT need to see a C-Section being performed on a sedated woman! JFC!
* Holy crap! Her mouth! This is some crazy body horror stuff! Like when you shop a dog's mouth on a horse!
* HUH! HUUUUH! Monster I haven’t seen before and an ending I hadn’t been expecting! Pretty good!
* I would watch this movie with a teenaged girl then explain to her how it's all a metaphor Man's fear of the connection women have with the Earth and Moon and Creation.

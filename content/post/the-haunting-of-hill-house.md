* Ohhh Theo~! <3<3<3

* In my original notes, all I had was that Theo line above. She's everying I'd want in a one-night stand.
* I have such a love/hate relationship with this show. On one hand, there was a lot of boring bits. On the other hand, ohhhhh Theo~! j/k. I liked that this explored what happens to a family AFTER a horror story plays out.
* Augh! The hanging lady! 
* Augh! All of the ghosts in house scenes peeking at youuuuu!
* Augh! The red room!
* Augh? The... wait, time travel? Psychic time travel? WTF?
* Cool! They had a room of requirement.
* Theo had the coolest power. Sorry not sorry.
* I hated myself for watching this show but I watched it all anyways. It was too much family drama for me but not quite enough horror, either. Still, I really liked the concept.
* I would watch this so I could talk about it at the office with my coworkers.

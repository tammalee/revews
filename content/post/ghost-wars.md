* Terrible acting!
<!--more-->
* Interesting premise
* I’m a sucker for a mystery
* Oh hey! That guy from Goon!
* Why am I still watching this?
* Okay. It’s over. I wasted an entire week on this crap.
* Look, I was in a low point of my life, I have meds now, I make better decisions
* I would watch this series if you like mysteries and don't mind crap being the answer.

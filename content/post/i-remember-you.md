* I’m having a hard time telling all of these bearded white men apart. XD
<!--more-->
* Freyr to the traumatized man who found a suicide victim: Hey, I’m a doctor. You know, people who hang themselves die because they can’t get blood to the brain. It’s like falling asleep. It’s pretty painless.
Traumatized man: o___o
* Okay. So. We’re in… Iceland? The doctor who examined a boy’s arm was asked to sub in for a pathologist at a crime scene but he’s actually a psychiatrist? Talk about cross-crafting!
* Ooooh the same graffiti 60 years later? Are we talking about a ghoooost?
* It’s a slow build but I’m starting to get creeped out.
* I, too, have been freaked out sleeping in a creepy wooden cabin. I feel you, Katrin. Also, I think Lif is sleeping with your husband. I’ll be so disappointed if it’s true. It’s just so cliché. A woman loses her child and is suffering mental issues and doesn’t want to have sex so the man, who has /needs/, starts banging her hot friend/sister/cousin/whatever.
* WHO the heck is alone in a rented cabin, hears someone enter who doesn’t respond to hello, then FOLLOWS THE WET FOOTPRINTS INTO THE CELLAR? Especially with an injured leg? Ugh. I feel these people are too trusting!
* It’s taken me… three sessions so far to watch this movie? It has creepy parts but it’s not gripping me. 
* It IS very interesting to see the setting and the people. Is this what a largely homogenously white place/population looks like? Kinda boring. Kinda… 70’s looking.
* Freyr is the shittiest psychiatrist. The way he deals with the old schizophrenic woman and the young autistic child is terrible.
* UGH DUMB DUMB DUMB
* So DUMB
* How did I spent so much time watching this? DUMB
* Maybe I’m missing cultural clues? But this was dumb.
* I would watch this if I wanted to look at lovely scenery and hear a language we don't often get to hear in N.America.

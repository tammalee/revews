* I like the opening with the obituary. Neat way to introduce us to, I assume, the characters we’ll be watching.
<!--more-->
* That is a sweet-ass tree house
* Slow pan over a sweet-ass studio space with SINISTER MUSIC. My dudes. I want that studio. I won’t make little dioramas in it, tho, I’d just do what I do with my current studio and set up half-finished painting projects all over the place. I am comfortable with who I am.
* hahaah what is this? A set for ants?! 
* Oooh I don’t care for the exterior of this house yet. Still a sweet-ass treehouse, tho. Too bad it’s built RIGHT NEXT to the driveway. Pfft. That’s hardly a secret hideaway.
* Also, who lets their kids sleep right up until there’s someone waiting in the car to go? 
* okay, sure, there was some horrifying stuff but more like, tragedy horrifying. Not scary movie horrifying.
* Ugh. UGH. I am so uncomfortable being drawn into their family drama like this. And… I’m also out of popcorn.
* Know what else bugs me? Dramatic scary music overlaying perfectly ordinary and NOT SCARY scenes.
* Wha? Wut?! *tongue pop* Damn.
* DAMN! What the aitch-eee-double-hockey-sticks is going on?
* NAKED OLD PEOPLE AIEEEEE!
* Welp. That was a totally unexpected ending. Was NOT expecting that. Huh. That was pretty alright!
* I would watch this on Victoria Day weekend safe in the knowledge I had Monday off in case I couldn't sleep after watching it.

* Big brother. You seem like your adrenal glands are burned right out.
<!--more-->
* Srsly. I want to say he’s calm through a lot of the weirdness but he just sort of goes… slack? The urgency drains away and I’m left feeling like, dude, DUDE, are you not concerned about the third moon?!!?!
* However, I also feel you. I have a little brother, too. There’s no talking sense to them.
* I liked that this wasn’t AT ALL what I had thought it would be!
* I didn’t like that older brother’s actor very much. I felt he could’ve done a better job with emoting. 
* There were a lot of ummm moments for me but by the end I was totally on board with this strange little slice of WTF pie!
* …I also feel it was more science fiction than horror. Just because people go splat doesn’t automatically make it horror, imo.
* I would watch this with a group of friends then argue about it afterwards.

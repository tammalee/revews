* It had a fairly interesting mystery that… was NOT what i had been expecting, at all!
<!--more-->
* However, I only know because I googled for the plot to see if I should keep watching
* Two or three episodes was all I could manage before I switched to something else
* Honestly, I got tired of the main character
* I would watch this show if I was bored and my bathrooms didn’t need cleaning
